# DevOps and CI/CD

This project involves setting up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the testing, build, and deployment processes. The pipeline will be configured using tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, or GitHub Actions. Additionally, the project includes monitoring application performance and health using tools like Prometheus and Grafana.

## Features

- __CI/CD Pipeline Configuration__: Set up a continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline.
- __Automated Testing__: Integrate automated testing into the pipeline.
- __Automated Build and Deployment__: Automate the build and deployment processes.
- __Application Monitoring__: Use monitoring tools to track application performance and health.
